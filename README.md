# Week 8 - Day 1 HW

### 1. `How do you make a Circle in CSS?`
  - Set the CSS border-radius property of an HTML element to 50%. Control the size using height and width in CSS. Element with a higher stack order number will always be placed in front of an element with a lower stack order number. 
  
### 2. `What is Z-index?`
  - The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element. It only works on positioned elements and flex items. 
  
### 3. `What is a Vendor Prefix and What is it's Purpose?`
  - Vendor prefixes are a way for your browser to support new CSS features before they become fully supported in all browsers. Whenever CSS releases new features, not all of them are immediately supported on every browser, so vendor prefixes help developers use the new features without having to wait for each of them to become available for every browser.
  
### 4. `What is the difference between CSS Grid and Flexbox?`
  - Grid is 2 dimensional while flexbox is one dimensional (linear). Grid is generally layout focused, while Flexbox is generally content focused.
  
### 5. `How might you Speed Up a Slow App?`
  - Lighthouse appears to be a popular tool to help improve webpage quality. You give Lighthouse a URL to audit, it runs a series of audits against the page, and then it generates a report on how well the page did. From there, use can use the failing audits as indicators on how to improve the page. Each audit has a reference doc explaining why the audit is important, as well as how to fix it.

### 6. `What is CRUD?`
  - Create, Read, Update, and Delete. These are the four basic functions that models should be able to do, at most. It's common in constructing web applications, because it provides a memorable framework for reminding developers of how to construct full, usable models.
  
### 7. `What is OOP?`
  - Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. OOP focuses on the objects that developers want to manipulate rather than the logic required to manipulate them. This approach to programming is well-suited for programs that are large, complex and actively updated or maintained.
